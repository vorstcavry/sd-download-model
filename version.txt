- Supports extension usage without `--gradio-queue` (ported from [onedotsix](https://github.com/etherealxx/batchlinks-webui/tree/onedotsix))
- Supports running shell command from the UI with `!` (for example: type `!pip freeze`, then hit the `Download all!` button and see the colab console)
- Progress bar for `--gradio-queue`

Changes:
- `aria2` as *the only* download method when using without `--gradio-queue`

## v2.0.0
Features:
- `aria2` as download method.
- Cancel button for cancelling download process (`--gradio-queue` required)
- Debug snapshot.<br/>
When `global_debug = True`, the moment this extension launch, it saves the current state of the webui on various location (into `snapshot.txt`), and when you type `#debugresetdownloads` on the textbox, it will compare the current state and the last saved state, and removes every new file/folder. This will be useful for debugging and testing.
- Debug every download method.<br/>
When `global_debug = True` and you type `#debugevery method` on the textbox, every link that has 4 different method of download (Huggingface etc.) will be downloaded with every method, regardless of the radio button choice. The result is 4 file being downloaded.
